`@superset-ui/legacy-*` packages are extracted from the classic [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset) and converted into plugins.
These packages are extracted with minimal changes (almost as-is). They also depend on legacy API (`viz.py`) to function.

`@superset-ui/plugin-*` packages are newer and has higher quality in general.
A key difference that they do not depend on `viz.py`
(which contain visualization-specific python code) and interface with
`/api/v1/query/` instead: a new generic endpoint instead meant to
serve all visualizations.

We are not accepting pull requests for new community-contributed plugins to be merged into this repository at the moment.
We will keep it lean for now to improve the standard and reduce operational load on maintenance.
Bug fixes are welcome.

In the future, we plan to have a template for new repository or generator for everybody to setup a single plugin repository easily on his/her own.
This way anybody can create and publish a Superset plugin.
